# Daily Summary Report - October 23, 2025

## üéØ Project: PokeUnlimited PokeData Platform
**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Focus:** Multi-Language Card Data Enrichment & Asset Management

---

## üìä Executive Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive multi-language support for the Pokemon TCG card catalog, resolved critical asset loading issues, and established automated enrichment infrastructure for 15 languages. Addressed database gaps and implemented fallback strategies for missing TCGdex API data.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Data Enrichment Infrastructure**
- **Enrichment Script Enhancement**
  - Modified `enrich_cards_from_tcgdex.py` to include `image_url` field in update process
  - Added COALESCE logic to preserve existing data while updating NULL values
  - Ensures all future enrichments automatically populate card images

- **Automation Scripts Deployed**
  - `enrich_remaining_languages.sh`: Sequential processing of 14 languages with automatic progression
  - `check_enrichment_status.sh`: Real-time progress monitoring across all 15 languages
  - `enrich_all_languages.sh`: Parallel enrichment capability for faster processing
  - `monitor_enrichment_status.sh`: Continuous status tracking with auto-refresh
  - `watch_enrichment.sh`: Live progress display with color-coded status
  - `quick_stats.sh`: Rapid database statistics for quick checks

### 2. **Asset Management & Fix Scripts**

#### Logo URL Issues Resolved
- **Problem:** Non-English sets displayed placeholder icons instead of collection logos
- **Root Cause:** TCGdex API only provides logo URLs for English language sets
- **Solution Implemented:**
  - Created `fix_logo_urls_use_english.py`: Copies English logo URLs to matching non-English sets
  - Created `fix_logo_urls_final.py`: Uses English asset paths directly for all languages
  - **Results:**
    - German: 126 sets updated (93% coverage)
    - Spanish: 101 sets updated (76% coverage)
    - French: 133 sets updated (76% coverage)
    - Italian: 132 sets updated (78% coverage)
    - Dutch: 3 sets updated (100% coverage)
    - Polish: 2 sets updated (100% coverage)
    - Russian: 9 sets updated (100% coverage)
    - Japanese: 4 sets updated (3% - only sets with English equivalents)
  - Set logo_url to NULL for 28 Japanese-exclusive sets (PMCG, PCG, web, VS, ADV, E series)

#### Card Image URL Issues Resolved
- **Problem:** Old Japanese and German cards showing "No Image" placeholders
- **Root Cause:** TCGdex API doesn't provide image URLs for legacy non-English cards (pre-2010s)
- **Solution Implemented:**
  - Modified enrichment script to include image_url field going forward
  - Created `fix_missing_image_urls.py`: Attempts to populate from TCGdex API (found limitations)
  - Implemented English image fallback strategy using SQL UPDATE with JOIN
  - **Results:**
    - Japanese: 14 cards updated
    - German: 4,346 cards updated
    - Spanish: 300 cards updated
    - French: 1,476 cards updated
    - Italian: 173 cards updated
    - **Total: 6,309 cards now have images**

### 3. **Frontend API Integration**

#### API Service Refactoring (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`)
- **Before:** Calling non-existent `/api/v1/tcgdex/sets` endpoints
- **After:** Using `/api/v1/pokedata/sets` and `/api/v1/pokedata/cards` with language parameters
- **Changes:**
  - `getSets(lang)`: Now queries database tables with language support
  - `getSetCards(setId, lang)`: Fetches cards from `pokedata_cards_{lang}` tables
  - `getSetDetails(setId, lang)`: Gets set information from `pokedata_sets_{lang}` tables
  - Added response transformation to match existing TCGCard/TCGSet interfaces
  - **Impact:** Fixes blank screen issue when clicking non-English sets

#### Frontend Page Updates
- **CardsPage.tsx:**
  - Added language parameter extraction from URL query string
  - Falls back to localStorage if URL param missing
  - Passes language to all API calls
  - Updates React Query cache keys to include language

- **SetsPage.tsx:**
  - Integrated language selector with API calls
  - Passes selected language to `getSets()` API function
  - Appends `?lang=` parameter to set detail URLs
  - Implements `handleLanguageChange()` to persist selection in localStorage

### Active Enrichment Processes
- **Spanish Enrichment:** Currently running (PID 1364887) - 41.8% complete
- **Background Script:** `enrich_remaining_languages.sh` (PID 1318884) managing sequential processing

### Estimated Timeline
- **Spanish completion:** ~1-2 hours (9,204 cards remaining)
- **Full enrichment (all 14 languages):** ~2-4 hours total
- **Process:** Sequential to avoid API rate limiting (0.3s delay between requests)

### Enrichment Methodology
1. Fetch card metadata from TCGdex API using tcgdexsdk library
2. Update database with: category, rarity, illustrator, HP, types, stage, attacks, abilities, weaknesses, resistances, retreat cost, regulation mark, image URLs
3. Preserve existing data using COALESCE - only update NULL values
4. Rate limiting: 0.3 second delay between API calls to respect TCGdex limits
5. Batch processing: 100 cards per batch for optimal performance

## üîç Technical Discoveries & Limitations

### TCGdex API Limitations
1. **Logo URLs:** Only provided for English language sets
   - Non-English sets return no `logo` attribute in API responses
   - Workaround: Use English logo URLs for all languages (Pokemon logos are language-agnostic)

2. **Card Images:** Only provided for newer cards (post-2010s era)
   - Legacy cards (PMCG series, early Neo, e-series, ADV, PCG, VS, web) lack `image` field
   - Affects: Japanese, German, and other non-English old cards
   - Workaround: Use English card images as fallback (visuals are identical, only text differs)

3. **Language-Specific Sets:** Some sets are region-exclusive
   - Japanese-exclusive: PMCG1-6, PCG1-2, VS1, web1, E1-5, ADV1-5 (153 sets)
   - Korean-exclusive: 89 sets with unique tcgdex_id patterns
   - Thai-exclusive: 65 sets
   - Indonesian-exclusive: 63 sets
   - **Impact:** These sets will display placeholder icons (acceptable limitation)

### Database Architecture Insights
- Per-language tables: `pokedata_cards_{lang}`, `pokedata_sets_{lang}`
- Foreign key: `set_id` links cards to sets via `tcgdex_id`
- Image coverage varies by language/era:
  - Modern sets (SV, SWSH): 95-99% image coverage
  - Legacy sets (pre-2010): 40-80% image coverage before fixes
  - Post-fix: 95%+ coverage across all enriched languages
